CODE: The R program "TRR proc_2020_2024" in the "CPD-Mental-Health/Code" folder is used to process CPD Tactical Response Report data for 2020-2024.

RAW DATA: The program imports data from the "CPD-Mental-Health/Raw Data" folder.

PROCESSED DATA: The program exports data to the "CPD-Mental-Health/Processed Data" folder.

USAGE NOTES: 
The processed data is a count of TRRs by Ward and Subject Race. This represents each report filed by an officer. 

Note that multiple officers often fill out a TRR for the same subject. This should NOT be used as a count of UNIQUE incidents, but rather a count of officers who used force on a given subject.
